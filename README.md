# InfoHound
During the reconnaissance phase, an attacker searches for any information about his target to create a profile that will later help him to identify possible ways to get in an organization. InfoHound uses passive analysis methods (which do not interact directly with the target) through OSINT to extract a large amount of data given a web domain name. This tool will retrieve emails, people, files, subdomains, usernames and urls to later analyzed and extract more valuable information.
